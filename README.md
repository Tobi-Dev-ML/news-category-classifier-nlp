# 📰 News Category Classifier using NLP

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to build a **text classification model** for news categorization.  
With a large influx of news articles daily, manual categorization is inefficient. Automating this process ensures **scalability, accuracy, and consistency**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To apply NLP methods for text cleaning and preprocessing  
- To train machine learning models for multi-class classification  
- To evaluate model performance using standard metrics  
- To automate news categorization for large-scale datasets

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK / SpaCy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Workflow
1. **Data Loading** – Import dataset containing labeled news articles  
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization  
3. **Feature Extraction** – TF-IDF Vectorization  
4. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, or SVM  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
6. **Prediction** – Classify new unseen text samples

## 📊 Results
The model achieved impressive accuracy on the validation dataset, demonstrating effective learning of textual patterns and topics.  
Performance metrics and confusion matrices highlight the model’s robustness across various categories.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning (LSTM / BERT) for better text understanding  
- Expand dataset to include multilingual articles  
- Deploy model as a REST API or web app
